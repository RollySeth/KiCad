![ChickTech Robot](images/P1080362.JPG) 
I designed this project for a 10-hour workshop for ChickTech.org whose goal is to introduce teenage women to STEM topics. The goals for this project were:

- Easy to build.
- Easy to program.
- Did something interesting.
- Low-cost so participants could take it home and continue to learn.

With those goals in mind, here were a couple of the design choices:

- Arduino compatible for ease of programming.
- 4xAA battery power for cost and availability.
- Stepper motors for accurate motion.
- 3D Printed for ease of customization.
- Pen plotting with Turtle graphics for interesting output.
- Open Source so you could make one of your own!

Bill Of Materials
=================

- See Assembly Instructions


Design Files
============
The electronics were designed using Open Source [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/). Design files are located in the [design_files](design_files/) folder.  You can oogle the [schematic](docs/Schematic.pdf).

The 3D Design files are located in the [3D](3D/) folder.

Firmware
========
This project is programed using the Open Source [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/). The firmware is located in the [firmware](firmware/) folder.  Instructions for setting up the Arduino enviroment for the Adafruit Trinket Pro are at [https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-pro-trinket](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-pro-trinket).
