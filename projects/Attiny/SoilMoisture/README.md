Design Files
============
This project is designed using Open Source [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/). Design files are located in the [design_files](design_files/) folder.  You can oogle the [schematic](docs/project.pdf).

Firmware
========
This project is programed using the Open Source [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/). I use my Open Source [AVR Programming Shield](https://www.tindie.com/products/MakersBox/yet-another-programming-shield/) to program the Attiny84. The firmware is located in the [firmware](firmware/) folder.
